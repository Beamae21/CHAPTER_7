# CHAPTER_7
Adding Animation to an App

In this chapter, Adding animation to a Flutter app enhances user experience by making the interface more interactive and engaging. Flutter provides robust support for animations, making it easy to add dynamic effects. I learned how to add animations to the app to improve the UX. I implemented AnimatedContainer to animate the width of a Container widget with a beautiful spring effect by using Curves. Adding the AnimatedCrossFade widget to cross-fade between two children widgets. The color is animated from amber to green while at the same time the widget increased or decreased in width and height. To fade a widget in, out, or partially, you added the AnimatedOpacity widget. The AnimatedOpacity widget uses the opacity property passed over a period of time (Duration) to fade the widget. The AnimationController class allows the creation of custom animations. I learned to use multiple AnimationControllers with different durations. Using two Animation classes to control the floating upward or downward and the inflation and deflation of the balloon at the same time. The animation is created by using Tween with begin and end values. Also using different CurvedAnimation class for a nonlinear effect like Curves.
